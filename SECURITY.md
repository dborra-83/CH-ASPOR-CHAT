# Security Policy

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

This project follows AWS security best practices:

### Infrastructure Security

1. **IAM Roles**: All Lambda functions use specific IAM roles with minimal required permissions
2. **Encryption**: 
   - S3 buckets use server-side encryption (SSE-S3)
   - DynamoDB tables have encryption at rest enabled
   - All data in transit uses HTTPS/TLS
3. **CORS**: API Gateway configured with specific allowed origins
4. **VPC**: Resources are isolated within appropriate network boundaries

### Application Security

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
2. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
3. **Error Handling**: Errors are logged without exposing sensitive information
4. **Rate Limiting**: API Gateway throttling configured to prevent abuse

### Data Protection

1. **PII Handling**: No personally identifiable information is logged
2. **Document Storage**: Documents are stored temporarily and can be configured for automatic deletion
3. **Access Control**: S3 buckets are private with presigned URLs for temporary access

## ðŸš¨ Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the maintainer directly at the repository owner's email
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## ðŸ“‹ Security Checklist for Deployment
